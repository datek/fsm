# FSM

A dead simple Finite State Machine in Golang.

## WARNING

The project has been moved to https://codeberg.org/datek/fsm

The github repo will be deleted in a short period.

## Why?
I looked at a couple of other libs on GitHub, but all of them were more complicated. Events, sources, destinations, callbacks, background context, whatever... I don't need those.  

A finite state machine can be defined only with _states_, if we assign each state a single _transition_, which returns the next state.

## Usage
Look at the tests.
